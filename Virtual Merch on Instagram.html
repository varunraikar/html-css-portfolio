            <p>Merch is not only T-shirts and mugs. It is primarily a promotion tool that is constantly changing and looking for new forms. Recently, it has migrated to the online environment and shows high performance and user engagement. Large companies and celebrities are investing heavily in the creation of masks and games on social networks. Let's try to figure out, together with an expert, what is needed to make virtual merchandise an effective promotion tool.</p>

        <h1>Where does the filter begin?</h1>
        <div class="container container-centre">
            <p>AR technologies that are successfully used in stories today are part of an SMM strategy. Targeted advertising is boring, no one notices banners, bloggers are less trusted, contests and "giveaways" show a decrease in user activity, but entertainment in stories is what works. AR filters allow you to add virtual objects to the environment, try on an unusual filter, or hang a toy from the ceiling. The subscriber himself chooses a filter or a game and, if he liked the effect, actively shares in his account. Any holiday or hype event is a powerful reason to launch new filters and story games. First, it's trendy. Secondly, there is a reason to actively advertise a new product. Thirdly, you can create an interactive and competition using AR capabilities.</p>

        <h1>Program for creating filters</h1>
        <div class="container container-centre">
            <p>To get high views, the filter or game needs to be fun and fun. These techniques are used by the singer Elena Temnikova, who actively used the capabilities of AR technologies in 2019 to support the new album. Before the New Year, she had two games at once. In one, it was necessary to hit the face with a snowball with the help of red mittens appearing on the screen. The second successful film imitated a sleigh ride with merry New Year's music. The games received several thousand views a day. It's great if the filter contains interactivity and comes to life with head movement or facial expressions. The same Elena Temnikova has a garland filter in her account, which starts blinking when you sing or smile. However, influencers try to create not only "cute" filters, but also experiment with original presentation. For example, Instagram blogger @juliaroga, who calls herself a filter artist, has created an interesting filter with Christmas designer white horns. It looks quite aggressive, but the filter has already been used by several thousand users around the world.</p>
