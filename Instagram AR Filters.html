        <h1>Impact on Business</h1>
        <div class="container container-centre">
            <p>Businesses are increasingly interested in augmented reality technology. According to the forecast MarketsandMarkets, AR market will grow by 46.6% annually in the next few years. This is because large IT corporations and tech companies like Facebook, Google and Samsung are actively investing in augmented reality. However, at the moment one of the most popular AR marketing tools is social media effects.</p>

        <h1>Why AR filters have become so popular?</h1>
        <div class="container container-centre">
            <p>We love to post ourselves on Instagram, we love when we are beautiful, funny. And filters allow you to do all this in a familiar social network interface. Their popularity was also influenced by the fact that the tool for creating filters was made public. Therefore, creativity does not end and everyone is constantly coming up with something new. The platform itself helps technology evolve.</p>

        <h1>How do filters created for a brand affect sale?</h1>
        <div class="container container-centre">
            <p>Filters can affect sales both directly and indirectly. If the user saw a beautiful filter, then person probably remembered it, as well as the brand that made it. Then that person can buy the product of this brand if they have to choose between them and the competitors. This is where the media effect works. Filters can directly affect sales. For example, you can try on some things, such as cosmetics or accessories, with filters. It's easier to buy a product if you already know how it looks on you. You can directly increase sales, but it's hard to track. There is no such functionality. How effective the filter is can be understood by indirect signs, such as increasing brand awareness or increasing traffic to the site. There are brands that all sell through Instagram. It is especially useful for them to have a filter, thus increasing customer engagement and activity.</p>

        <h1>Is the awareness of the brand that creates its filters growing?
        </h1>
        <div class="container container-centre">
            <p>Brand awareness is related to its activity. Now almost all major brands have their own social media and engage their audience through this channel. Everyone is trying to make a filter that goes viral. Users start to actively use it and look for an author, and then stumble upon a brand. Reaches are growing - this is because everyone is reposting and publishing.</p>

        <h1>How are companies using AR filters?</h1>
        <div class="container container-centre">
            <p>It all depends on the purpose of creating the filter. It can be situational or branded. In the first case, we are rather working with a warmed-up audience who initially followed the company on Instagram. Then the new filter is a kind of gift for the customers. In the second case, companies usually involve their ambassadors and partners in distributing the filter. It carries a certain brand attribute and colour, so that everyone immediately understands the authorship of the filter.</p>

        <h1>How else will AR be used in marketing?
        </h1>
        <div class="container container-centre">
            <p>Brand awareness is related to its activity. Now almost all major brands have their own social media and engage their audience through this channel.

        <h1>When will filters go out of style?</h1>
        <div class="container container-centre">
            <p>Marketing is tightly integrated into AR, there is something new every day. You can already look at any item in real size - for example, IKEA furniture or some Apple products on the official website. But it will become more interesting when we see augmented reality not through a phone, but through a lens, glasses. Then even more companies and users will take part in this AR revolution.</p>
